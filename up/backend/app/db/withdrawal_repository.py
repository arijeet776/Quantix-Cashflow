"""
Withdrawal workflow. The critical correctness property — no double
withdrawal, no race between two concurrent requests — comes from a
Postgres advisory transaction lock keyed per-publisher
(`pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(publisher_id))`), held for the duration of
the single transaction that both checks available balance AND inserts the
withdrawal_hold ledger entry. Two concurrent requests for the same
publisher serialize on that lock; the second one recomputes balance AFTER
the first committed, so it correctly sees the reduced balance.

Every status transition (approve/reject/pay/cancel) is a single
conditional UPDATE ... WHERE status = <expected> ... RETURNING *, the same
atomic-transition pattern used throughout this project (Part 2's
onboarding approvals, Part 3's campaign lifecycle) — only one concurrent
call can ever match and transition a given row.
