"""
PostgreSQL / Supabase connection pool - the financial system of record.
Raw asyncpg is used (not the Supabase SDK) because the earnings ledger needs
real multi-statement SQL transactions; see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for the
reasoning, flagged as an open decision.

Startup fix (Part 1 review): unlike Motor, asyncpg.create_pool() actively
tries to open connections and raises immediately if it can't. That means a
hard try/except is required at startup so a down Postgres doesn't crash the
whole process (which would also take /health/live down with it). If the
initial attempt fails, `_pool` stays None and ping_postgres() retries pool
creation on every readiness check until it succeeds — self-healing without
needing a background task.
