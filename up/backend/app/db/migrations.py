"""
Minimal SQL migration runner for the financial schema (Part 9). No ORM/
Alembic is introduced — this project has no other Postgres schema yet, so
a lightweight tracked-file-application runner is proportionate. Migrations
live in backend/migrations/*.sql, applied in filename order, each wrapped
in its own transaction, recorded in schema_migrations so re-running is a
no-op. Consistent with the rest of this app's startup philosophy: never
crash the process if Postgres is unreachable — log and let /health/ready
reflect reality (see app/db/postgres.py).
