"""
Email delivery, service-based per spec §45 — business endpoints call
`email_service.send(...)`, never a provider SDK directly, so a real
provider (SES/SendGrid/Postmark/etc.) can be dropped in later by
implementing the same interface without touching any endpoint code.

This environment has no real SMTP/provider credentials available, so the
default backend logs the email instead of sending it. That is a Part 1/2
foundation limitation, not a design choice to keep long-term — swap
`_backend` for a real provider adapter when credentials exist.

Per spec §46, only these lifecycle emails exist. There is no generic
"send any email" business-endpoint entry point, and this module makes it a
one-line change per email type rather than sprinkling send calls everywhere.
