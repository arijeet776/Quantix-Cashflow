"""
Campaign-specific data purge — Final Execution Directive §4-17.

WHAT THIS IS: permanent deletion of ONE selected, ENDED campaign's purgeable
operational data, scoped strictly by that campaign's canonical business
campaign_id.

WHAT THIS IS NOT: a database or collection wipe. The dependency map below is
backend-defined and complete; every delete is exactly
{"campaign_id": <the selected campaign's id>}. Publisher, manager and user
records, other campaigns' data, immutable config history, audit logs and ALL
financial records (Postgres/Supabase) are outside the purge boundary by
design — no code path in this module can reach them.
